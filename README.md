# HandGestureDrawingBoard
 Hand Gesture Drawing Board is an interactive virtual drawing application that allows users to draw on a digital canvas using only their hand gestures. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system detects hand movements and translates them into drawing actions such as drawing, erasing, changing colors, and clearing the canvas.
